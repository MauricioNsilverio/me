                        <p>I was awarded a full scholarship to attend a Business &amp; Leadership course through Summer Boarding Courses
                          (SBC) at St Hugh’s College at the University of Oxford between August 5-19th. During the course,
                          I learned market research, finances, SWOT analysis, branding and everything related to creating an innovative startup.
                          This experience helped shape my profile as an entrepreneur and also my actions towards the development of my own
                          business: iDuk.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Besides, I was invited to make a speech in front of the entire college. I talked about the scholarship program and
                          motivation in front of more than 186 students from over 30+ nationalities.

                          By the end of the week, we had to create a socially impactful business: that's when iDuk was born.
                          After pitching our idea, my group was invited to visit Geekie Software Development - one of the greatest educational
                          startups in Brazil - and also Ismart, an NGO that also offers educational opportunities to low-income students.
